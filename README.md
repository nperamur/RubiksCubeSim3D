This is my simple 3D rubik's cube simulator made in JavaFX. 
 It's features include an in-built timer, a scramble button that uses Tnoodle to generate WCA (World Cube Association) random-state scrambles, and uses keyboard-input for cube turning. 
 It builds on my previous <a href=https://github.com/nperamur/RubiksCubeSim> 2D Rubik's Cube Simulator </a> but utilizes a much better user interface:

Here are the default keybindings. You can change these in the menu found by clicking escape. 

R = Right side

U = Up side

L = Left side

D = Down side

F = Front side

B = Back side

M = Middle slice

E = Equator slice

S = Side slice

Everything is clockwise by default unless you hold shift while pressing it where that would be counterclockwise instead. In order to do wide moves, you would additionally have to hold control.
